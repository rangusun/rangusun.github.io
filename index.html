        ScheduleMe is a time management app that integrates a detailed to-do list with a user-friendly visual calendar. 
        With ScheduleMe, users can efficiently manage their to-do list items in the same place as their upcoming events and appointments. 
        Additionally, to help users with decision paralysis, our app uses machine learning to rank to-do list items according to factors such as user habits, due dates, and priorities. 
        By combining calendar and to-do list workflows, the app's flexible scheduling process adapts to the unpredictability of daily life.

        What is the Problem?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Students, professionals, people with disabilities, athletes, and parents can all have troubles with planning, procrastination, and burnout. 
        While simple to-do lists and calendars can help users track their plans, they do not typically help users make their plans. 
        It is up to users to find the best time to work on flexible responsibilities or self-care activities amidst their already busy schedules.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why is Our App Different?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Instead of passive record-keeping, ScheduleMe takes a proactive role in helping users make their plans.  
        First, the app makes a key distinction between to-do list items and events. 
        Events are scheduled responsibilities, such as class, work, softball practice, or doctor’s appointments. 
        On the other hand, to-do list items are not scheduled, though they may have a deadline. 
        To-do list items include things like household chores, homework,and self-care activities. 
        Next, the app helps users find space for their to-do list items in between scheduled engagements. 
        Using our drag-to-create functionality, users can select and schedule a time to work on to-do list items within seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, our tool, SuggestMe, helps users choose what to work on through machine learning. 
        Powered by SciKit Learn, the app can rank the user’s to-do list according to the user’s past habits, task priority ratings, and deadlines. 
        This allows users to make quick decisions and save time figuring out what needs to happen next.
